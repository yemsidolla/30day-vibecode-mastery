# Day 24 – Testing Strategy

## Learn

- Unit test prompts (how to ask the AI to write unit tests).
- Integration test prompts (how to ask for API or flow tests).
- QA validation prompts (how to ask for manual test scenarios or acceptance criteria).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Create prompt templates (or docs) for: (1) generating unit tests, (2) generating integration tests, (3) QA validation / test scenarios. Optionally add a few tests to `apps/ecommerce/` using these prompts.

## Outcome

You're done when you have reusable test-generation prompts and at least one example test (unit or integration) in the repo.
