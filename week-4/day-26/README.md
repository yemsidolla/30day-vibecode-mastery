# Day 26 – Complexity Audit

## Learn

- Ask the AI to list unnecessary complexity; then refactor aggressively.
- Reduce cognitive and maintenance load without removing features.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Run a complexity audit on `apps/ecommerce/`: "List all unnecessary complexity." Then refactor to remove or simplify the biggest items.

## Outcome

You're done when you've removed or simplified at least 2–3 sources of unnecessary complexity and the app still works.
