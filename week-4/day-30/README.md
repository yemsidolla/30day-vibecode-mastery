# Day 30 – Final Challenge

## Learn

- Design your own **AI-First Dev Company System**: org structure, prompt governance, multi-agent rules, code standards, deployment, monitoring.
- Operate like a CTO: systems and process, not just code.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Design the full system and write it up. Deliverable: a document (e.g. `docs/final-system-design.md`) that describes how an AI-first dev company would run.

## Outcome

You're done when you have a complete system design document that you could use to run or join an AI-first engineering org. You are now operating at a CTO level for this workflow.
