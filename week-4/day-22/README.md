# Day 22 – Performance Awareness

## Learn

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders (frontend).
- Avoid unnecessary DB calls (backend).
- Minimal API payload (only what the client needs).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Refactor `apps/ecommerce/` for performance: identify and fix re-render issues, redundant queries, and oversized responses.

## Outcome

You're done when you've applied at least one performance improvement in each area (frontend, backend, API payload) and the app feels or measures better.
