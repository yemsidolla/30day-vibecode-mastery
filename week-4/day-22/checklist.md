# Day 22 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 23, confirm:

- [ ] I reviewed the frontend for unnecessary re-renders and applied at least one improvement (e.g. memoization).
- [ ] I reviewed the backend for redundant or N+1 DB calls and applied at least one improvement.
- [ ] I reduced at least one API payload to return only needed fields.
- [ ] Behavior is unchanged; performance is improved or measured.
- [ ] I did not add new features—only performance refactors.
