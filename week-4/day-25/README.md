# Day 25 – Production Readiness Checklist

## Learn

- A concrete checklist so the app is safe to ship: logging, feature flags, errors, no debug leftovers, clean structure.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Build a production-readiness checklist and run it against `apps/ecommerce/`. Fix or document any gaps.

## Outcome

You're done when you have a reusable checklist and the e-commerce app passes it (or has a short list of remaining items).
