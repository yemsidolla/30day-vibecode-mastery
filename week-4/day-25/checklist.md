# Day 25 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 26, confirm:

- [ ] I created a production-readiness checklist (logging, feature flags, errors, no debug leftovers, clean structure, secrets, security).
- [ ] I ran the checklist against `apps/ecommerce/`.
- [ ] I fixed or documented each gap.
- [ ] I recorded the checklist status (Pass or list of remaining items) and saved it (e.g. in `docs/production-readiness-checklist.md`).
