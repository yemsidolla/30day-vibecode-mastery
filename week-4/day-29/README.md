# Day 29 – Capstone Project

## Learn

- Extend the e-commerce app into something that resembles a small SaaS: admin, orders, analytics, feature flags per segment.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Extend `apps/ecommerce/` with: admin dashboard, order management, simple analytics, and (optional) feature flags per user segment. Use the workflow and chunking you’ve learned.

## Outcome

You're done when the e-commerce app has admin, orders, analytics, and optionally segment-level flags—and feels like a shippable SaaS product.
