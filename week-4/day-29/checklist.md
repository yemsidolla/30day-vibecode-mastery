# Day 29 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 30, confirm:

- [ ] I added an admin dashboard (protected, with at least orders and product/flag management).
- [ ] I added order management (place order, order history, admin view).
- [ ] I added minimal analytics (e.g. orders, revenue, top products) and exposed them on the admin dashboard.
- [ ] (Optional) I extended feature flags to support segments and toggled them from admin.
- [ ] I used chunking and architecture-first for each new area.
- [ ] I documented the capstone scope (e.g. in `apps/ecommerce/docs/capstone.md`).
