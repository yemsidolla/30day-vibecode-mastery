# Day 28 – AI-First Company Workflow

## Learn

- Design the full AI-first development workflow: idea intake → architecture → implementation chunks → review → deploy → monitor → iteration.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Write a document that describes your AI-first development workflow. It can live in `docs/` or in the Week 4 folder. No code—only process and prompts.

## Outcome

You're done when you have a clear, reusable workflow doc that you (or a team) could follow for the next project.
