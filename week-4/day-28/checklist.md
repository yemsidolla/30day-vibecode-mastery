# Day 28 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 29, confirm:

- [ ] I wrote the AI-first workflow document covering: idea intake, architecture, implementation chunks, review, deployment, monitoring, iteration.
- [ ] I referenced the relevant prompt templates (architecture-first, chunking, refactor, governance, production checklist, monitoring).
- [ ] I saved the doc in the repo (e.g. `docs/ai-first-workflow.md`).
- [ ] The workflow is clear enough for someone else (or future me) to follow.
