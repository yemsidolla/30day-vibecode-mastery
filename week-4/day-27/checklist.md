# Day 27 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 28, confirm:

- [ ] I created `apps/ecommerce-rebuild/` and wrote the architecture and folder structure before any code.
- [ ] I built the rebuild in strict chunks (no "full system" prompts).
- [ ] I used anti-overengineering constraints in every prompt.
- [ ] The rebuild is functional (products, cart, auth at minimum).
- [ ] I compared with `apps/ecommerce/` and documented what I did differently (e.g. in `rebuild-notes.md`).
