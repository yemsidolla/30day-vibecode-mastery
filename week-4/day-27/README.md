# Day 27 – Rebuild From Scratch (Controlled)

## Learn

- Prove mastery: rebuild the same e-commerce app with perfect architecture first, strict chunking, zero overgeneration.
- Compare with the evolved codebase to see what you’d do differently.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Rebuild the e-commerce app (or its core: products + cart + auth) in a new folder (e.g. `apps/ecommerce-rebuild/`) using architecture-first design and strict chunking. No "build everything" prompts.

## Outcome

You're done when the rebuild exists, was built under tight control, and you can articulate what you did differently from Day 7 onward.
