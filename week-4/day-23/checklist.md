# Day 23 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 24, confirm:

- [ ] I added input validation to API endpoints (types, required fields, ranges); invalid input returns 400.
- [ ] I enforced role-based or user-based access (e.g. cart and profile only for the owning user).
- [ ] I added basic rate limiting to at least auth (and optionally other sensitive) endpoints; 429 when exceeded.
- [ ] I documented validation, access, and rate limits (e.g. in `docs/security.md`).
