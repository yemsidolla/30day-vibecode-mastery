# Day 23 – Security Hardening

## Learn

- Input validation on API boundaries.
- Role-based access (who can do what).
- Basic rate limiting logic (optional but good to have).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Add input validation, role-based access where it matters, and (optionally) simple rate limiting to `apps/ecommerce/`.

## Outcome

You're done when the e-commerce app validates inputs, enforces access rules, and optionally rate-limits sensitive endpoints.
