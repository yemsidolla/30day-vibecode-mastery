# Day 5 – Debug Prompting

## Learn

Debug pattern:

1. Analyze issue
2. List possible causes
3. Identify most likely
4. Suggest minimal fix

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/debug-pattern.md](../../prompts/debug-pattern.md).

Intentionally break something in your blog app, then fix it using the structured debug prompt (analyze → causes → most likely → minimal fix).

## Outcome

You're done when you've fixed a real bug using the debug pattern and avoided a large, unnecessary rewrite.
