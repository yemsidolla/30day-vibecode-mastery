# Day 5 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 6, confirm:

- [ ] I intentionally introduced a bug in the blog app.
- [ ] I used the debug pattern (analyze → list causes → most likely → minimal fix) from `prompts/debug-pattern.md`.
- [ ] The AI suggested a minimal fix, not a large refactor.
- [ ] I applied the fix and the bug is resolved.
- [ ] I can reuse this debug pattern for future issues.
