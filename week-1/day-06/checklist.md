# Day 6 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 7, confirm:

- [ ] I chose a clear scope for the refactor (whole blog or specific module/files).
- [ ] I used the "refactor without changing behavior" instructions from `prompts/refactor-no-behavior-change.md`.
- [ ] I specified refactor goals (e.g. remove duplication, simplify, rename).
- [ ] After the refactor, behavior is unchanged (manual check or quick test).
- [ ] I did not allow behavior-changing "improvements" in the refactor.
