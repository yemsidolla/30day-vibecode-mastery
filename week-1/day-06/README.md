# Day 6 – Refactoring AI Code

## Learn

- When to refactor (e.g. after a feature works but structure is messy).
- How to instruct the AI to clean code (refactor without changing behavior).
- Avoid rewriting everything—target specific areas.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/refactor-no-behavior-change.md](../../prompts/refactor-no-behavior-change.md).

Ask the AI to refactor your blog (or a part of it) with the instruction: "Refactor without changing behavior."

## Outcome

You're done when the blog has been refactored for clarity/structure and behavior is unchanged.
