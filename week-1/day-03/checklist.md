# Day 3 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 4, confirm:

- [ ] I defined the blog architecture in one prompt (no code).
- [ ] I defined the folder structure in a separate prompt (no code).
- [ ] I implemented the post list in one prompt only.
- [ ] I implemented the single post view in one prompt only.
- [ ] I added the app shell/routing in a final prompt.
- [ ] The blog app lives in `apps/blog/` and was built in 5 chunks, not one big prompt.
