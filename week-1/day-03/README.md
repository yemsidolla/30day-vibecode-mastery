# Day 3 – Chunking Strategy

## Learn

- Never ask for the full system in one prompt.
- Always break into: **Architecture** → **Folder structure** → **One module** → **One function** (or component).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/chunking-rules.md](../../prompts/chunking-rules.md).

Build a small blog app in **5 chunks** (e.g. architecture, folder structure, post list module, single post view, routing/shell) instead of one "build a blog" prompt.

## Outcome

You're done when the blog exists and was built one chunk at a time, with review after each chunk.
