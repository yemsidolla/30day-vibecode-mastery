# Day 7 – Week 1 Mini Project

## Learn

Apply Week 1: controlled prompting, chunking, no overengineering.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/chunking-rules.md](../../prompts/chunking-rules.md) and [../../prompts/anti-overengineering.md](../../prompts/anti-overengineering.md).

Build a **simple e-commerce landing page**: product list, cart (local state only), clean folder structure.

**Rules:** No backend, no unnecessary abstraction, controlled prompting only (structure + constraints).

## Outcome

You're done when you have a working landing with products and cart in [../../apps/ecommerce](../../apps/ecommerce), built with scoped prompts and minimal structure.
