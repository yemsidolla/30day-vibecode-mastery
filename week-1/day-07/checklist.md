# Day 7 – Checklist

Before moving to Week 2, confirm:

- [ ] I built the e-commerce landing in chunks (architecture → folder → product list → cart → page).
- [ ] I used the anti-overengineering constraints (no extra features, minimal implementation).
- [ ] The app has: product list, cart with local state only, clean folder structure.
- [ ] No backend and no unnecessary abstraction.
- [ ] The app lives in `apps/ecommerce/`.
