# Day 2 – Prompt Structure Framework

## Learn

- **ROLE** — Who the AI is acting as.
- **GOAL** — One clear outcome.
- **CONSTRAINTS** — What NOT to do.
- **CONTEXT** — Brief context if needed.
- **OUTPUT FORMAT** — How you want the answer (e.g. one file, one component).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use the shared template in [../../prompts/framework-role-goal-constraints.md](../../prompts/framework-role-goal-constraints.md).

1. Generate a small landing page using the structured prompt (ROLE / GOAL / CONSTRAINTS / CONTEXT / OUTPUT FORMAT).
2. Compare with an unstructured prompt (e.g. "Make a landing page").

## Outcome

You're done when you've built one landing with the framework and seen how it differs from an unstructured request.
