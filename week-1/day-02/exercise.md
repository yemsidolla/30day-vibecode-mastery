# Day 2 – Exercise

## Reference

Use the template: [../../prompts/framework-role-goal-constraints.md](../../prompts/framework-role-goal-constraints.md).

## Step 1: Unstructured prompt (for comparison)

**Prompt:** "Make a landing page for a product."

Generate and note: how many files, did it add extra pages or features, is the scope clear?

## Step 2: Structured prompt

Fill in each section and send to the AI:

- **ROLE:** e.g. "You are a frontend developer building a minimal landing page."
- **GOAL:** e.g. "Create a single-page landing with a hero section and one call-to-action button."
- **CONSTRAINTS:** e.g. "No backend. No extra pages or routes. One HTML file or one React component. No animations."
- **CONTEXT:** e.g. "This is for a 30-day vibe coding exercise on scope control."
- **OUTPUT FORMAT:** e.g. "One file (or one component). No README unless I ask."

Generate the landing page.

## Step 3: Compare

- Did the structured prompt produce a smaller, more focused result?
- Was it easier to get exactly what you wanted by editing the sections?

Save the landing page from Step 2 in [../../apps/landing](../../apps/landing).
