# Day 1 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 2, confirm:

- [ ] I ran an uncontrolled "Build me a TODO app" prompt and observed overgeneration.
- [ ] I rewrote the prompt with clear constraints (scope, no extra features, minimal structure).
- [ ] I compared the two outputs (files, features, complexity).
- [ ] I can explain why uncontrolled prompts create messy code.
- [ ] My minimal TODO app is in `apps/todo/` (or I know what I'd keep from the second run).
