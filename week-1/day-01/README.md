# Day 1 – What is Vibe Coding (Mindset Shift)

## Learn

- Why traditional dev thinking fails with AI (asking for "everything" leads to bloat).
- Why prompting is system design (your prompt defines scope and structure).
- Why clarity > verbosity (short, explicit constraints beat long descriptions).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md) for step-by-step instructions.

1. Ask AI to build a simple TODO app with no constraints.
2. Observe overgeneration (extra features, layers, files).
3. Rewrite the prompt to constrain scope and generate again.

## Outcome

You're done when you understand why uncontrolled prompts create messy code and you've seen the difference after constraining the same request.
