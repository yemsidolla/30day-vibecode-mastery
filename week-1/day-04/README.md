# Day 4 – Preventing Overengineering

## Learn

- "Do NOT add extra features."
- "Keep implementation minimal."
- "No abstraction unless required."

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/anti-overengineering.md](../../prompts/anti-overengineering.md).

Refactor your blog app (from Day 3) to reduce: unnecessary services, over-modularization, duplicate patterns. Use the anti-overengineering prompt to guide the AI.

## Outcome

You're done when the blog does the same thing with less structure and fewer unnecessary layers.
