# Day 4 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 5, confirm:

- [ ] I audited the blog for unnecessary services, over-modularization, and duplicate patterns.
- [ ] I used the anti-overengineering prompt (or its phrases) to guide the refactor.
- [ ] The refactored blog has fewer unnecessary layers and files.
- [ ] Behavior is unchanged (same pages, same data, same interactions).
- [ ] I did not add new features during the refactor.
