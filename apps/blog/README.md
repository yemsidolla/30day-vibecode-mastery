# Blog App

**Built on:** Days 3–6 (Week 1)

**Purpose:** Small blog app built in 5 chunks (architecture → folder structure → post list → single post view → routing). Refactored on Day 4 (anti-overengineering), debugged on Day 5, refactored without behavior change on Day 6.

**Stack:** TBD (choose early and keep consistent).

Build your blog here following the chunking rules in `prompts/chunking-rules.md`.
