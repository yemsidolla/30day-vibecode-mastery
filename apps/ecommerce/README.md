# E-commerce App

**Started:** Day 7 (Week 1). **Grows through:** Week 2 (auth, API, DB, feature flags), Week 3 (multi-agent, logging, infra), Week 4 (performance, security, testing, capstone).

**Purpose:** Main project for the roadmap. Starts as a simple landing (products + cart, local state only). Then: architecture, folder governance, auth, backend API, database, feature flags, refactor, multi-agent simulation, logging/monitoring, infra, performance, security, testing, production checklist, complexity audit, and capstone (admin, orders, analytics, segment flags).

**Stack:** TBD (e.g. React + Node, or Next.js full-stack). Choose by Day 2 and stick with it.

Build and extend this app as you progress through the 30 days. See `ROADMAP.md` and each week’s day folders for instructions.
