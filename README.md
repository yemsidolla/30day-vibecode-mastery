# 30-Day Vibe Coding Mastery Roadmap

This repo is the **30-Day Vibe Coding Mastery Roadmap**: curriculum by day plus the apps you build. It holds both the learning materials (by week and day) and the codebases for the exercises (TODO, landing, blog, e-commerce).

## How to use

1. **Start at** [week-1/day-01/](week-1/day-01/) and work through each day in order.
2. **Use** the shared [prompts/](prompts/) templates whenever a day references them (e.g. structured prompts, debug pattern, chunking).
3. **Build** in [apps/](apps/): `todo`, `landing`, `blog`, and `ecommerce` — the e-commerce app grows from Day 7 through Day 29.

## Full curriculum

See **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** for the complete 30-day curriculum with all learning goals, exercises, and outcomes.
