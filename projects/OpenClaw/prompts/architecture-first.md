# Architecture first

Before writing code for OpenClaw, define:

- **Components:** Frontend Dashboard, Backend API, WebSocket Engine, Agent Registry, Docker Monitoring, Scheduler, Reporting, Governance.
- **Boundaries:** What each service owns; what it does not do.
- **Folder structure:** Where each piece lives under `app/`.

Deliver: ASCII diagram, service responsibility table, folder proposal. No implementation until approved.

See MASTER-PROMPT.md Phase 0.
