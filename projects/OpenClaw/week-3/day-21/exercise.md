# Day 21 – Exercise

## Steps

1. Start backend and frontend. Walk through: send a command (as Operator/Admin), see it in log and broadcast; trigger or show a governance violation; show alerts and health %; try unauthorized action (e.g. Viewer sending command) and see 403.
2. Fix any bugs or missing wiring from Days 15–20. Do not add new features.
3. Optional: document the demo in `docs/week3-demo.md`.

You now have: Command AI team, Governance enforcement, Alerts, Health engine, Real monitoring, RBAC. Week 4 is production and mastery.
