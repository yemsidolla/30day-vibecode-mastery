# Day 15 – AI Chat Command Center

## Learn

- Chat UI: select target agent, send command, receive response, store conversation logs.
- Think internal Slack but AI team only.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use **MASTER PROMPT Phase 6** ([../../MASTER-PROMPT.md](../../MASTER-PROMPT.md)) for protocol and endpoint.

Build the Command Center UI: chat interface, agent selector, send command. Backend: command endpoint + logging + broadcast (no AI execution yet).

## Outcome

You're done when you can select an agent, send a command (e.g. text), see it logged and broadcast, and (optionally) see a placeholder response in the UI.
