# Day 15 – Checklist

- [ ] I designed the command protocol and saved it in `docs/command-protocol.md`.
- [ ] I implemented the command endpoint (validate, log, broadcast); no AI execution yet.
- [ ] I built the Command Center UI (select agent, send command, see sent/log).
- [ ] I did not add real AI execution. I am ready for Day 16 (enforce protocol).
