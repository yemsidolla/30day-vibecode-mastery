# Day 17 – Governance System

## Learn

- Policy rules: prevent agents from overwriting architecture, changing other domains, creating duplicate services.
- Violation Log: record and display governance violations.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use **MASTER PROMPT Phase 9** ([../../MASTER-PROMPT.md](../../MASTER-PROMPT.md)) design.

Design governance rules and violation logging. Implement minimal middleware or checks that log violations (e.g. command attempts that violate policy). Add a Violation Log view in the dashboard.

## Outcome

You're done when governance rules are documented, violations are logged when a command (or action) breaks policy, and the dashboard has a Violation Log panel or section.
