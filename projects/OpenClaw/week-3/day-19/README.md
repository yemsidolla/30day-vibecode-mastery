# Day 19 – Alert System

## Learn

- Alerts for: agent stuck, Docker down, CPU > threshold, failed scheduled job.
- Notification center panel in the dashboard.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use **MASTER PROMPT Phase 8** ([../../MASTER-PROMPT.md](../../MASTER-PROMPT.md)).

Define alert rules, implement alert storage and notification broadcast, and add a Notification Center panel in the UI.

## Outcome

You're done when alert rules are documented, alerts are stored and broadcast (e.g. via WebSocket), and the dashboard has a Notification Center showing recent alerts.
