# Day 6 – Checklist

- [ ] I documented how Docker stats are collected and at what frequency.
- [ ] I implemented a Docker status endpoint (container name, status, CPU %, memory %).
- [ ] The endpoint works (with real Docker or a mock).
- [ ] I did not add extra fields or services beyond the minimal scope.
- [ ] I have approval to proceed to Day 7.
