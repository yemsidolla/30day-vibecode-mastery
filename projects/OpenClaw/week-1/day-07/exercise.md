# Day 7 – Exercise

## Steps

1. Start backend and frontend. Ensure WebSocket connects and agent list loads.
2. Trigger simulated agent status changes; confirm the dashboard updates in real time.
3. Call the Docker status endpoint (or show the panel with mock data if Docker is not available).
4. Note any bugs or missing pieces from Days 1–6; fix them without adding new features.
5. Optional: record a short demo or document the flow in `docs/week1-demo.md`.

You now have: AI Agent registry, Realtime updates, Docker monitoring, Basic UI. Week 2 builds on this.
