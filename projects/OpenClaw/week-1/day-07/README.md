# Day 7 – Week 1 Demo

## Learn

- Consolidate Week 1: Agent registry, realtime updates, Docker monitoring, basic UI.
- Run a single end-to-end demo.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Run the full stack. Demonstrate: list agents with live status updates, Docker container list (if available), and a single flow from backend to frontend. Fix any gaps from Days 1–6.

## Outcome

You're done when you can demo AI Agent registry, realtime status updates, Docker monitoring (or mock), and basic dashboard UI in one run.
