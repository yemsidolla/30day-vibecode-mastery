# Day 4 – Real-Time Engine

## Learn

- WebSocket updates and broadcast of agent status changes.
- Simulated agent activity stream for testing.
- Agent states: idle, thinking, coding, error.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use **MASTER PROMPT Phase 2, Step 2.3** ([../../MASTER-PROMPT.md](../../MASTER-PROMPT.md)).

Add WebSocket broadcast on agent status change. Add a simulated activity stream so you can test agents switching between idle, thinking, coding, error.

## Outcome

You're done when status changes are broadcast over WebSocket and you can test agents moving between states (e.g. via simulated updates).
