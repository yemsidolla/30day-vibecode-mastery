# Day 1 – Define the System Architecture

## Learn

- Layers: Frontend (Dashboard UI), Realtime Engine (WebSocket), AI Agent Registry, Monitoring Service, Docker/Server Collector, Task Scheduler, Reporting Engine.
- Service boundaries and folder structure before any code.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use **MASTER PROMPT Phase 0** ([../../MASTER-PROMPT.md](../../MASTER-PROMPT.md)).

Define high-level components and deliver ASCII architecture diagram, service responsibility table, folder structure. No coding yet.

## Outcome

You're done when [../../docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md) exists with the diagram and boundaries, and you have approval before Day 2.
