# Day 28 – Analytics Intelligence

## Learn

- AI efficiency trend, project velocity, infra cost estimation, agent workload heatmap.
- Add analytics endpoints and visualizations to the dashboard.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Add analytics: efficiency trend (e.g. tasks completed over time), project velocity, simple infra cost estimate (e.g. server/container hours), and agent workload heatmap (which agent is busiest / most stuck). Expose via API and show in the UI.

## Outcome

You're done when the dashboard shows at least two of: efficiency trend, project velocity, cost estimate, or workload heatmap.
