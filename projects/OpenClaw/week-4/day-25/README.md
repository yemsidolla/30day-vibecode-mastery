# Day 25 – Environment Awareness

## Learn

- Dev vs Production mode (verbose logs, debug endpoints only in dev).
- Multi-server awareness (e.g. which server instance, or future multi-node).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Support NODE_ENV (or similar) for dev vs production: reduce verbosity in prod, disable debug routes in prod. Document multi-server or multi-instance considerations in docs.

## Outcome

You're done when the app behaves correctly in dev and production mode and env awareness is documented.
