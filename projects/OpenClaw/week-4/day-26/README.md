# Day 26 – Deployment System

## Learn

- Containerization: Frontend, Backend, Database, Monitoring worker.
- Design strategy first; then minimal docker-compose. Use **MASTER PROMPT Phase 10** ([../../MASTER-PROMPT.md](../../MASTER-PROMPT.md)).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Design containerization (services, networks, env, secrets). Generate a minimal docker-compose that runs frontend, backend, and (if used) database and monitoring worker.

## Outcome

You're done when [../../docs/containerization.md](../../docs/containerization.md) exists and you have a working docker-compose (or equivalent) to run the stack.
