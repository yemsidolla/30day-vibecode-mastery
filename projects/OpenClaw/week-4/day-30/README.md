- You're building a platform.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Design (do not implement) the v2 roadmap. Document in [../../docs/v2-roadmap.md](../../docs/v2-roadmap.md): plugin system, multi-workspace support, AI marketplace, external API integrations, mobile view, voice command interface. Prioritize and add rough timeline or phases if helpful.

## Outcome

You're done when the v2 roadmap is written and you can articulate the next evolution of OpenClaw. You have completed the 30-day AI Command Center build.
