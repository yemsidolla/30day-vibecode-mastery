# Day 30 – Exercise

## Steps

1. Write [../../docs/v2-roadmap.md](../../docs/v2-roadmap.md) with sections (or bullets) for:
   - **Plugin system:** How third-party or internal plugins could extend agents, panels, or commands.
   - **Multi-workspace support:** Multiple teams or workspaces with separate agent registries and projects.
   - **AI marketplace:** Catalog of agents, templates, or integrations that users can add.
   - **External API integrations:** Webhooks, REST API for external tools to send commands or read status.
   - **Mobile view:** Responsive or dedicated mobile dashboard.
   - **Voice command interface:** Voice input for commands (conceptual or high-level design).
2. Add rough priority or phases (e.g. "Phase 1: Plugins + API; Phase 2: Multi-workspace; Phase 3: Marketplace and mobile"). No code. STOP.
3. Celebrate. You have an AI Command Center and a clear v2 direction. Now you're building a platform.
