# Day 29 – Exercise

## Steps

1. Design CEO view: one screen or panel with Company health % (from Day 18), Active projects count and status, Agent utilization (e.g. how many idle vs busy), Server/Docker stability (e.g. all up or count of issues), Risk warnings (e.g. top 3 alerts or health issues).
2. Add backend endpoint if needed (e.g. GET /ceo-summary) aggregating existing data. STOP.
3. Build CEO Dashboard route or panel in frontend: large health %, key numbers, risk list. Minimal styling; focus on clarity. STOP.
4. List files created; get approval. Ready for Day 30 (Final challenge).
