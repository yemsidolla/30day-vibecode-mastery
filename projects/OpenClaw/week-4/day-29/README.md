# Day 29 – CEO Dashboard View

## Learn

- Executive panel: Company health %, Active projects, Agent utilization, Server stability, Risk warnings.
- One-glance clarity for leadership.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Build a CEO Dashboard view (or top-level summary panel): single place showing overall health %, active project count, agent utilization summary, server/Docker stability, and risk warnings (e.g. from alerts or health). Keep it minimal and scannable.

## Outcome

You're done when there is a dedicated CEO/executive view or summary that gives one-glance clarity on company health, projects, agents, infra, and risks.
