# Day 27 – Scaling Design

## Learn

- Horizontal scaling, event queue, microservice separation, agent registry centralization.
- Update architecture diagram with scaling view.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Plan (do not implement) horizontal scaling: how you would run multiple backend instances, use an event queue, separate services, and centralize the agent registry. Update the architecture doc with a scaling section or new diagram.

## Outcome

You're done when [../../docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md) (or a new doc) describes the scaling plan and updated architecture.
