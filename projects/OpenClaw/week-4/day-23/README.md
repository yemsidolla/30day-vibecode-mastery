# Day 23 – Performance Optimization

## Learn

- WebSocket efficiency (e.g. avoid redundant broadcasts, throttle if needed).
- Avoid over-rendering in the frontend.
- Efficient polling for Docker (interval, minimal payload).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Optimize WebSocket usage, frontend re-renders, and Docker polling. Measure or document improvements.

## Outcome

You're done when you've applied at least one optimization in each area (WebSocket, frontend, Docker) and the app feels or measures better.
