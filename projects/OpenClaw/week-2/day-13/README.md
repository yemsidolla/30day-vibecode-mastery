# Day 13 – Task Scheduler Integration

## Learn

- Scheduled tasks: cron jobs, next run time, last run result.
- Connects to server tasks, AI automated prompts, monitoring checks.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Add a Scheduler service (or integration): store scheduled jobs, next run time, last run result. Expose an endpoint or panel so the dashboard can show scheduled tasks.

## Outcome

You're done when the system has a notion of scheduled tasks (and optionally a simple scheduler that runs them), and the dashboard can show next run and last result.
