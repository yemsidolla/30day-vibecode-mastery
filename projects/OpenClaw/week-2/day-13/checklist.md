# Day 13 – Checklist

- [ ] I have a scheduler service (or stub) that stores jobs with next run and last result.
- [ ] I exposed an endpoint (or data) for scheduled tasks.
- [ ] The dashboard shows scheduled tasks (next run, last result).
- [ ] I did not add full cron execution yet if out of scope; minimal is OK. I am ready for Day 14.
