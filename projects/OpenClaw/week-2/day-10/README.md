# Day 10 – Animated AI Office

## Learn

- Grid layout for the AI office; agent avatars; status-based color and minimal animation.
- Real-time movement/updates so the office "feels alive."

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use **MASTER PROMPT Phase 5, Step 5.2** ([../../MASTER-PROMPT.md](../../MASTER-PROMPT.md)).

Build the AI Office view in the frontend: grid, avatars, status color, simple animation. Connect to WebSocket for real-time updates.

## Outcome

You're done when the dashboard has an AI Office view with a grid, one avatar per agent, status-based color (and optional minimal animation), and live updates from the backend.
