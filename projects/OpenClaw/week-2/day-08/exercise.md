# Day 8 – Exercise

## Steps

1. Define rooms: CEO Office, CTO War Room, Backend Bay, Frontend Studio, DevOps Control Room, QA Lab. Which agents belong in which room (by role)?
2. For each agent in the UI: avatar (e.g. icon or initial), activity animation idea (e.g. "pulse when thinking"), status color (idle=gray, thinking=yellow, coding=green, error=red, offline=dimmed).
3. Sketch or describe the grid layout: how rooms are arranged, how agents appear inside each room.
4. Save the concept in [../../docs/ai-office-concept.md](../../docs/ai-office-concept.md) or extend [../../docs/dashboard-layout.md](../../docs/dashboard-layout.md). No code yet. STOP.
