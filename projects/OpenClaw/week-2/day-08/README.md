# Day 8 – Design AI Office Concept

## Learn

- UI concept: rooms (CEO Office, CTO War Room, Backend Bay, Frontend Studio, DevOps Control Room, QA Lab).
- Each agent: avatar, activity animation, status color.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use **MASTER PROMPT Phase 5** ([../../MASTER-PROMPT.md](../../MASTER-PROMPT.md)) design thinking.

Design the AI Office UI concept and room-to-agent mapping. No implementation yet.

## Outcome

You're done when you have a clear design (and optionally a doc in [../../docs/](../../docs/)) for rooms and agent placement, and you're ready to define the state machine on Day 9.
