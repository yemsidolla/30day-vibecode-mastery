# Day 11 – Project View Module

## Learn

- Project model: name, progress %, active agents, deadlines, issues.
- Dashboard: Kanban-style overview, project health indicator. Inspired by Linear.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Add Project entity (backend + schema if not already in schema.md). Add a Project view/panel in the dashboard: Kanban-style or list, with progress and health indicator.

## Outcome

You're done when projects can be listed (and optionally created/updated), and the dashboard has a Project Overview panel with progress and health.
