# Day 9 – Activity Engine

## Learn

- Behavior logic: agent receives task → "thinking"; coding → show animation; error → red blinking.
- State machine for agents: idle, thinking, coding, error, offline. Define transitions.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use **MASTER PROMPT Phase 5, Step 5.1** ([../../MASTER-PROMPT.md](../../MASTER-PROMPT.md)).

Define the AI Office state machine (states and transitions). Save in docs. Optionally implement the state logic in the backend (no UI animation yet).

## Outcome

You're done when [../../docs/ai-office-state-machine.md](../../docs/ai-office-state-machine.md) exists and you have clear rules for when an agent moves between states.
