# Day 9 – Checklist

- [ ] I defined all states (idle, thinking, coding, error, offline) and transitions.
- [ ] I saved the state machine in `docs/ai-office-state-machine.md`.
- [ ] (Optional) Backend or simulator respects the state machine when updating agent status.
- [ ] I did not implement the visual animation yet. I am ready for Day 10.
