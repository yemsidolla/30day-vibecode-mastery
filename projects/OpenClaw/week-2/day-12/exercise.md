# Day 12 – Exercise

## Steps

1. Design report data: what you need for "agent productivity," "errors per day," "task completion rate," "infrastructure uptime." Use existing agents, tasks, alerts, Docker. Add a short doc or section in `docs/` if needed. STOP.
2. Implement minimal report endpoints in backend (e.g. GET /reports/productivity, GET /reports/errors). Use in-memory or stub data if real data is not yet available. STOP.
3. Add a Reports panel in the frontend: fetch one or two report endpoints, display with a simple chart (e.g. bar or line) or table. Use a lightweight chart library or plain HTML/CSS. STOP.
4. List files created; get approval.
