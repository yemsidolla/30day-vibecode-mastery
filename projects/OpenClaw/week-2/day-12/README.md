# Day 12 – Report Engine

## Learn

- Reports: agent productivity, errors per day, task completion rate, infrastructure uptime.
- Simple chart integration in the dashboard.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Build a minimal report engine in the backend (aggregate data for productivity, errors, task completion, uptime) and expose endpoints. Add a simple reports/charts panel in the frontend.

## Outcome

You're done when the dashboard can show at least one report (e.g. agent productivity or errors per day) with simple chart or table.
