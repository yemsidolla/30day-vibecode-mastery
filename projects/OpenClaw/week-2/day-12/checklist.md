# Day 12 – Checklist

- [ ] I defined report metrics (productivity, errors, task completion, uptime) and how to compute them.
- [ ] I implemented at least one report endpoint in the backend.
- [ ] I added a Reports panel in the frontend with a simple chart or table.
- [ ] I did not overbuild (e.g. no complex analytics yet). I am ready for Day 13.
