# Day 8 – System Thinking

## Learn

- **UI layer** — What the user sees and interacts with.
- **API layer** — Endpoints, request/response; what the frontend calls.
- **Data layer** — Persistence, schema, queries.
- **Infrastructure layer** — Hosting, env, secrets, where it runs.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/architecture-first.md](../../prompts/architecture-first.md).

Draw (or describe) the architecture of your e-commerce app in layers **before** writing new code. Output ASCII diagram or bullet list.

## Outcome

You're done when you have a clear layer diagram (UI / API / Data / Infrastructure) for `apps/ecommerce/` and use it to guide the next days.
