# Day 14 – Week 2 Mini Project

## Learn

Apply Week 2: clean boundaries, clear separation, no duplicate logic.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Refactor the entire e-commerce system (frontend, backend, auth, DB, feature flags) for clean boundaries, clear separation of concerns, and no duplicate logic.

## Outcome

You're done when the e-commerce app is refactored so layers and responsibilities are clear and duplication is removed.
