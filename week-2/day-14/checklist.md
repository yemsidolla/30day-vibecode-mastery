# Day 14 – Checklist

Before moving to Week 3, confirm:

- [ ] I audited the e-commerce app for boundaries, separation, and duplication.
- [ ] I refactored for clean boundaries (API vs UI vs data) and clear separation by domain.
- [ ] I removed or centralized duplicate logic.
- [ ] Behavior is unchanged after refactor (auth, products, cart, flags all work).
- [ ] No new features were added during the refactor.
