# Day 13 – Feature Flag System

## Learn

- Simple feature flag table and API (inspired by Unleash, Flagsmith, GrowthBook).
- Toggle a feature in the UI.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Build a minimal feature-flag system: store flags (e.g. name, on/off) in a table and expose them to the frontend so you can toggle a feature in the UI.

## Outcome

You're done when the e-commerce app has a feature flag table and a UI (or admin toggle) that can turn a feature on or off.
