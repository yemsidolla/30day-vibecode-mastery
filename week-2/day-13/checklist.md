# Day 13 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 14, confirm:

- [ ] I designed the feature flag schema and API (GET list, PATCH toggle) before coding.
- [ ] I added a flags table and backend endpoints.
- [ ] The frontend fetches flags and uses at least one flag to show/hide a feature.
- [ ] I can toggle that flag (e.g. via a simple admin/dev UI) and see the change.
- [ ] The implementation is minimal (global flags only; no segments yet).
