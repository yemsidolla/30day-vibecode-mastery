# Day 12 – Add Database

## Learn

- **Schema design first**, then **migration plan**, then implementation.
- Avoid: "Generate full backend system" in one go.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/chunking-rules.md](../../prompts/chunking-rules.md).

Add a real (or dev) database to `apps/ecommerce/`: design schema and migration steps in prompts before implementation.

## Outcome

You're done when the e-commerce app has a defined schema, a migration approach, and persistence for users, products, and cart.
