# Day 12 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 13, confirm:

- [ ] I designed the DB schema (tables, columns, keys) before writing migrations.
- [ ] I wrote a short migration plan (order of creation, seed strategy).
- [ ] I implemented migrations/table creation and connected the API to the DB.
- [ ] Products, cart, and users persist correctly.
- [ ] I did not prompt for "full backend system" in one go—chunked by schema, then implementation.
