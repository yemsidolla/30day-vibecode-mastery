# Day 9 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 10, confirm:

- [ ] I defined folder and naming conventions for the project.
- [ ] I restructured `apps/ecommerce/` to match the architecture and conventions.
- [ ] Placeholder or real folders exist for client, server/API, and docs.
- [ ] Folder layout is documented (e.g. in README or docs/structure.md).
- [ ] (Optional) I applied similar cleanup to `apps/blog/`.
