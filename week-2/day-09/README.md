# Day 9 – Folder & Repo Governance

## Learn

- Clean structure and naming conventions.
- How to prompt the AI for folder cleanup and consistent layout.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Restructure `apps/ecommerce/` (and optionally `apps/blog/`) to match your architecture and naming rules. Use an AI folder-cleanup prompt if helpful.

## Outcome

You're done when the project has a clear, consistent folder structure that matches the architecture from Day 8.
