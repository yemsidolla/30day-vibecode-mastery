# Day 11 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 12, confirm:

- [ ] I defined all API endpoints and request/response schemas before coding.
- [ ] I implemented the Products API (list + single product).
- [ ] I implemented the Cart API (get, add, update, remove).
- [ ] Auth API is aligned and documented with the rest.
- [ ] The frontend uses the new API for products and cart; behavior is correct.
- [ ] API spec is saved (e.g. in `docs/api.md`).
