# Day 11 – Add Backend API

## Learn

- Define **endpoints first**, then **request/response schema**, then implementation.
- Products API, Cart API, Auth API (if not fully done on Day 10).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/architecture-first.md](../../prompts/architecture-first.md) and [../../prompts/chunking-rules.md](../../prompts/chunking-rules.md).

Add a backend API for products and cart (and align auth) in `apps/ecommerce/`. Define endpoints and schemas in a prompt before generating code.

## Outcome

You're done when the e-commerce app has a defined API (products, cart, auth) and working implementation.
