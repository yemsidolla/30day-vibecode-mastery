# Day 10 – Add Authentication

## Learn

- Prompt for **flow design first**, then code.
- Auth pieces: login, register, session handling.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/architecture-first.md](../../prompts/architecture-first.md).

Add login, register, and session handling to `apps/ecommerce/`. Design the flow and endpoints (or session contract) in a prompt **before** asking for implementation.

## Outcome

You're done when auth flow is designed first and then implemented in `apps/ecommerce/` (UI + backend).
