# Day 10 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 11, confirm:

- [ ] I designed the auth flow (register, login, session, logout) before writing code.
- [ ] I defined the auth API (endpoints + request/response) before implementation.
- [ ] I implemented auth in chunks (backend first, then frontend, then integration).
- [ ] Login, register, and session handling work in `apps/ecommerce/`.
- [ ] The auth flow and endpoints are documented (e.g. in `docs/auth.md`).
