# Day 21 – Checklist

Before moving to Week 4, confirm:

- [ ] I ran the full simulation: CEO → CTO → Architect → Backend → Frontend → QA → DevOps.
- [ ] I used the agent role definitions and handoff template from Days 16–17.
- [ ] Each step produced a clear handoff for the next (or a final deliverable).
- [ ] The coupon feature is either implemented in `apps/ecommerce/` or fully specified for implementation.
- [ ] I documented the simulation (e.g. in `docs/simulation-day21.md` or `apps/agent-sim/`).
