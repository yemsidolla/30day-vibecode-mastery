# Day 21 – Week 3 Simulation

## Learn

- Run a full AI startup workflow: CEO → CTO → Architect → Devs → QA → DevOps.
- One feature end-to-end with handoffs.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Simulate the full workflow for one new feature: **"Add discount coupon system."** Use your agent roles and handoff template. Optionally use a separate folder (e.g. `apps/agent-sim/`) for prompts and outputs.

## Outcome

You're done when you've run the full chain (idea → CTO scope → Architect design → Backend + Frontend → QA validation → DevOps notes) and the coupon feature (or its spec) is delivered.
