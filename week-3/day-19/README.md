# Day 19 – Logging & Monitoring

## Learn

- Structured logs, error-tracking simulation, and a monitoring prompt system (inspired by PostHog-style thinking).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Add structured logging to `apps/ecommerce/` and define a simple "monitoring prompt" (what to ask the AI when investigating errors or behavior).

## Outcome

You're done when the e-commerce app has structured logs and you have a reusable prompt for "how to investigate issues" using those logs.
