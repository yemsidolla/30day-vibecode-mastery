# Day 19 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 20, confirm:

- [ ] I added structured logging (consistent format: time, level, message, context) to the backend.
- [ ] Errors are logged with enough context to debug later.
- [ ] I wrote a "monitoring prompt" or doc for investigating issues using logs (steps to reproduce, analyze, fix, improve logging).
- [ ] I saved the monitoring prompt (e.g. in `docs/monitoring-prompt.md`).
