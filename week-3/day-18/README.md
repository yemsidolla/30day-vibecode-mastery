# Day 18 – Governance Agent

## Learn

- An agent that reviews structure, prevents duplication, enforces architecture rules, and cleans the workspace.
- Define what "governance" means in prompts (checklists and constraints).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Create the **Governance Agent** role and prompt: it reviews the repo for structure, duplication, and architecture compliance and suggests (or outputs) cleanup tasks.

## Outcome

You're done when you have a Governance Agent prompt that you can run against `apps/ecommerce/` (or the repo) to get a review and cleanup list.
