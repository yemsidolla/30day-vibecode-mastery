# Day 18 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 19, confirm:

- [ ] I defined the Governance Agent role (scope: review and recommend; no implementation).
- [ ] I wrote a governance prompt that reviews: structure, duplication, architecture, cleanup.
- [ ] The prompt output is a report (lists + recommended actions), not code changes.
- [ ] I ran the Governance Agent once against `apps/ecommerce/` and got a concrete list of issues/actions.
