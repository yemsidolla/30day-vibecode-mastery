# Day 16 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 17, confirm:

- [ ] I defined all six roles: CTO, Architect, Backend, Frontend, QA, DevOps.
- [ ] Each role has clear Scope, Allowed actions, and Constraints.
- [ ] I used the template from `prompts/agent-roles.md`.
- [ ] Role definitions are saved (e.g. in `docs/agent-roles.md`) for reuse.
