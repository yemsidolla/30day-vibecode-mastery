# Day 16 – Define Agent Roles

## Learn

- Create explicit roles: CTO, Architect, Backend, Frontend, QA, DevOps.
- Each role has: Scope, Allowed actions, Constraints.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/agent-roles.md](../../prompts/agent-roles.md).

Write down (or generate with AI) the six agent role definitions with scope, allowed actions, and constraints. Save them for Day 17 and the Week 3 simulation.

## Outcome

You're done when you have a clear role spec for each of the six agents that you can reuse in prompts and handoffs.
