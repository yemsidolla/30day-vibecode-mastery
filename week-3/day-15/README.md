# Day 15 – Single vs Multi-Agent

## Learn

- When a single agent fails (context overflow, too many responsibilities).
- Responsibility separation: split work into distinct roles.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Split a task (e.g. "add a new API and its frontend") into three agents: Architect, Backend, Frontend. Run each step as a separate prompt with clear handoff.

## Outcome

You're done when you've completed one feature by simulating Architect → Backend → Frontend with separate prompts and handoffs.
