# Day 17 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 18, confirm:

- [ ] I created an inter-agent handoff template (DELIVERABLE, SUMMARY, HANDOFF).
- [ ] The template includes: To, Context, Task, Constraints, No cross-role work.
- [ ] I saved the template (e.g. in `docs/inter-agent-handoff-template.md`).
- [ ] I practiced at least one handoff (e.g. Architect → Backend) using the template.
- [ ] The next agent only did what the handoff specified (no cross-role work).
