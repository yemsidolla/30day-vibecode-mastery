# Day 17 – Agent Communication Protocol

## Learn

- Define **output format** and **handoff structure** so the next agent knows what to do.
- No cross-role interference: each handoff states what the next agent must not do.

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md). Use [../../prompts/agent-roles.md](../../prompts/agent-roles.md) and [../../prompts/inter-agent-handoff.md](../../prompts/inter-agent-handoff.md).

Create a prompt template for inter-agent communication (deliverable + summary + handoff). Optionally run one handoff (e.g. Architect → Backend).

## Outcome

You're done when you have a reusable handoff template and have practiced one Architect → Backend (or similar) handoff.
