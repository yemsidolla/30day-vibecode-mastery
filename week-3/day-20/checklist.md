# Day 20 – Checklist

Before moving to Day 21, confirm:

- [ ] I listed and use environment variables for port, DB URL, and secrets (no hardcoded secrets).
- [ ] I added `.env.example` and ensured `.env` is gitignored.
- [ ] I documented dev vs prod behavior (or where to set NODE_ENV and secrets).
- [ ] I added a short "container awareness" note (config from env, PORT, no file-based secrets, optional health check).
- [ ] No secrets or credentials remain in the repo.
