# Day 20 – Infrastructure Awareness

## Learn

- Dev vs Prod: different config and behavior.
- Environment variables and secrets handling; no hardcoded secrets.
- Container awareness (what would need to change if you ran in Docker or a PaaS).

## Exercise

See [exercise.md](exercise.md).

Document and apply: env-based config, secrets from env (not in code), and a short "infrastructure checklist" for the e-commerce app.

## Outcome

You're done when the app (or its docs) clearly separate dev/prod, use env for secrets, and you have a short infra checklist (e.g. for future containerization).
